# PlaceReminder
iOS application for Mobile Development course
This is my first iOS application devoloped for Mobile Development course during my Bachelor Degree.
A user can save a placeholder that features:
- Geographic coordinates and address obtained by reverse geocoding or vice versa starting from an address by obtaining the geographical coordinates by forward geocoding
- Name and optionally a description
- Date and time of addition
Placeholders can be displayed in a list sorted by edit date and in a map.
Pressing a marker on the map shows a callout with general information and gives the ability to view all the details.
Placeholders can be deleted by the user. When the user enters the region (geofence) of an active reminder, the app generates a local notification.
